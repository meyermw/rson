This file contains samples for testing the tokenizer and parser.

In general, every time a linefeed is followed by three dashes and
another linefeed, it indicates the end of one sample and start of
another.

Also, single dashes are removed (to allow whitespace at the end
of a line for testing with editors that auto strip it), and two
consecutive dashes are treated as a tab character.
