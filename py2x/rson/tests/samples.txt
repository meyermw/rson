This file contains samples for testing the tokenizer and parser.

In general, every time a linefeed is followed by three dashes and
another linefeed, it indicates the end of one sample and start of
another.

Also, single dashes are removed (to allow whitespace at the end
of a line for testing with editors that auto strip it), and two
consecutive dashes are treated as a tab character.

---

In RSON, comments start with the # character.

# This is a comment

     # This is a comment too.

     -- -- # Comments can occur after tabs

---

Here are some example RSON tokens:
    [] "" {} / = :

@ is not really a token but is used as an internal indicator.

---

Different string types:

"""abc
"
""
"abc"
"\n"
 -

 "a\n\""

 ---

 Check tokens embedded in other stuff.

 kdf[a"bc2=]# xxx{}

 ---
 #Check comment on first line
